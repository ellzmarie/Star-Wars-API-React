In this lab, I'll consume the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation#starships) and render it's data using Visual Studio Code and React.

## Exercise

- Research documentation of SWAPI to find the endpoint for the starshipsresource.

- Start by writing everything in App.js; the creation of additional components can come later as you scale the project.

- Use the useEffecthook to fetch all the "starship"data from the API and store that data in component state using the useStatehook.

- Map over the array of starship objects in component state and render a card for each starship.

- Cards should contain the text of the starship's name.

- Choose a css in React method and apply some style to your components
